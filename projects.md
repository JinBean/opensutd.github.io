### Machine Learning

#### STATNLP

**Project Owner: Prof. Lu Wei**

Welcome to StatNLP, the NLP and Big Data Research Group in the ISTD pillar at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. Researchers in StatNLP focus on solving novel research problems in the NLP, machine learning and big data that may surpass traditional boundaries of data science technology.

The StatNLP was created in 2014. Currently, it is led by Prof Lu Wei, consisting of several graduate students and researchers. The group subscribes to the design spirit of SUTD.

Nevertheless, in a short period of time since its inception, the group has built a successful track record of publishing in the top ranked conferences. Members of StatNLP also collaborate with external organizations such as DSO National Laboratory.
