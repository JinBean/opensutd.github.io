# Welcome to OpenSUTD

A place for free and open knowledge sharing within and outside of the SUTD Community.

## What's this?

We aim to be a place where projects from SUTD (academic or not) can be

* Discovered and showcased on a public platform
* Exposed to a community/environment that encourages collaboration and contribution
* Archived with all the relevant information/documentation included to reproduce or continue work on the project if someone else is interested

We are still a work in progress, so please be patient while we iron out the best way to run this. Want to contribute? [Please do!](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/community)
